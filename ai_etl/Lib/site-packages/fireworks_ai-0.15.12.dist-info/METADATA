# Fireworks.ai Python library

Fireworks.ai Python Library provides a convenient API for accessing Fireworks supported LLMs. We are targeting our API to be very similar to OpenAI's API so you can replace OpenAI usage with minimal modifications

## Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade fireworks-ai
```

## API definitions
Please check our [completion](https://fireworksai.readme.io/reference/createchatcompletion) and [chat completion](https://fireworksai.readme.io/reference/createcompletion) API reference for the arguments we support and the meaning of each arguments.

## Example code

### List

```python
import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "your-key"
print(fireworks.client.Model.list())
```

```
object='list' data=[Model(id="accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v2-7b", object="model", created=0), ...]
```

### Completion

```python
import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "your-key"
completion = fireworks.client.Completion.create("accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3-8b-instruct", "Once upon a time", temperature=0.1, n=2, max_tokens=16)
print(completion)
```

```
id='8bd3ac8f-a7d3-4dab-a19e-cea3f9c83f1e' object='text_completion' created=1714831539 model='accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3-8b-instruct' choices=[Choice(index=0, text=', there was a young girl named Sophia who lived in a small village surrounded by', logprobs=None, finish_reason='length', raw_output=None), Choice(index=1, text=', there was a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest. The', logprobs=None, finish_reason='length', raw_output=None)] usage=UsageInfo(prompt_tokens=4, total_tokens=36, completion_tokens=32)
```

### Streaming completion

```python
import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "your-key"
for completion in fireworks.client.Completion.create(
    "accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3-8b-instruct",
    prompt="Once upon a time",
    temperature=0.1,
    n=2,
    max_tokens=16
):
    print(completion)
```


### Async completion

```python
import asyncio
import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "your-key"
async def main():
    response = await fireworks.client.Completion.acreate("accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3-8b-instruct", "Once upon a time", echo=True, max_tokens=16)
    print(response.choices[0].text)
asyncio.run(main())
```

then run the script

```
$ python test.py
Once upon a time, there used to be a huge mountain that was the most famous mou
```

### ChatCompletion

```python
import fireworks.client
fireworks.client.api_key = "your-key"
completion = fireworks.client.ChatCompletion.create(
    "accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3-8b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello there!"}],
    temperature=0.7,
    n=2,
    max_tokens=16
)
print(completion)
```

```
id='cmpl-ec241c8f5b8d50bcf792f2df' object='chat.completion' created=1691896960 model='accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v2-7b-chat' choices=[ChatCompletionResponseChoice(index=0, message=ChatMessage(role='assistant', content=" Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can"), finish_reason='length'), ChatCompletionResponseChoice(index=1, message=ChatMessage(role='assistant', content=" Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can"), finish_reason='length')] usage=UsageInfo(prompt_tokens=23, total_tokens=55, completion_tokens=32)
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
